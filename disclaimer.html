                            held by you. Do conduct your due diligence and consult your financial advisor before making

                            By purchasing $SOGE, you agree that you are not purchasing a
                            security or investment, and you agree to hold the team harmless and not liable for any
                            losses or taxes you may incur. You also agree that the team is presenting the token "as is"
                            and is not required to provide any support or services. You should have no expectation of
                            any form from $SOGE Token and its team. Although SnoopDoge is a community-driven
                            decentralized finance (DeFi) token for social networking and not a registered digital
                            currency, the team strongly recommends that citizens in areas with government bans on
                            cryptocurrencies do not purchase it because the team cannot ensure compliance with
                            established regulations within certain territories.
